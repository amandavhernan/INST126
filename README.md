# Project 1: Building a Calculator
This is my first project for INST126 at the University of Maryland. For this project, I converted a flowchart that contained all of the major steps to create basic calculator into a working python program. 
I decided to take it a bit further and added more functionality to my calculator. In addition to the basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), my calculator can also take the square root of any number, raise any number to the power of 2 or 3, and take the natural logarithm of any number. I also added a loop, which allows the user to continue entering operations until they type "quit".

## How it works
When the user runs this program, it will ask the user to choose an operation by using the menu provided. Make sure to enter the numerical label given to each operation. 
For example, if the user wants to choose "Add", they must enter "1". If the user wanted "Square Root, they must enter "5" and so on. If the user does not enter a valid number/operation (1-8), the program will not run and the user will see an error. 
The error prompts the user to try again by entering a number between 1 through 8. If the user wants to stop the program, they must enter "quit" when prompted for an operation.
